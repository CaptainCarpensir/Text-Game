# Text-Game
Just making a text based game in C++ for fun

I need to overhaul how some stuff works because I'm fairly certain I went a bit overboard with the classes
Also learning how to use a new IDE, and figuring out some basic C++ and git stuff :)

TO DO LIST:
1. Relearn the old code
2. Overhaul any bad implementation
3. ROOM FEATURE - I need to figure out how to make rooms have separate identities, and get random generation
   which will start from when the player enters the room, rather than on initialization
4. Command additions, make the game more sense
5. Actual challenges - be it traps or enemies, the game needs more spice
6. Difficulty levels? Will probably make it so that you can choose rough game size
7. Descriptions - This should be implemented all the way along, but hopefully I can give some identity to rooms
   and other things by added pools of descriptions which can be selected randomly
